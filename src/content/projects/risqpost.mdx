## Executive Summary

Traditional monitoring tools track mentions and sentiment. But they miss context:  
- Who is posting?  
- What is their influence?  
- Are they a competitor or a recurring detractor?  

Risqpost closes this gap. It gives teams context-aware risk scoring, modular dashboards, and AI-assisted drafting. The result is faster, smarter responses that protect your brand in real time.

**TLDR:** Risqpost is a turnkey solution for social risk.  
Built to defend brands, empower teams, and reduce costly mistakes.

## Key Takeaways

- Sentiment alone is not enough. Context makes risk actionable.  
- AI buffers speed up drafting without removing the human voice.  
- Unified dashboards keep analysis, alerts, and recommendations in one lens.

## The Origin Story

Defensive communications has long needed a deeper layer than generic sentiment.  
Managing brand risk online requires answers to harder questions:  
- Is this post worth responding to?  
- Does it overlap with competitor narratives?  
- Is the author consistently negative or influential?  

Risqpost began with these questions. It was designed as a modular platform that turns chaotic social noise into clear signals.  
Drafting responses is no longer starting from scratch. An AI buffer provides contextually relevant drafts you can edit and humanize.
