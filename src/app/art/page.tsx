          <li>Sandbox: shapes loop and gradually respawn over time.</li>
          <li>Battle: pick a winner (shape type), then start — a black hole grows until one remains (≤ 60s). The hole appears during countdown and pulls only after GO.</li>
          <li>Destruction: collisions can shatter shapes into smaller pieces and colorful particles (per‑session only).</li>
